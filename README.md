# AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Iris Dataset

This repository contains the solution for **Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** as part of the **AI & ML Internship**.  
The objective of this task is to explore data patterns, relationships, and important features using visualizations and statistical insights.

---

## 📌 Dataset Used
- **Iris Dataset**
  - 150 samples
  - 4 numerical features:
    - Sepal Length
    - Sepal Width
    - Petal Length
    - Petal Width
  - Target variable: **Species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is clean, balanced, and widely used for classification problems.
